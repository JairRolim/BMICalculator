# BMICalculator

My goal with this app was to learn and develop my skills in Android, while also offering a useful and user-friendly tool to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI). Besides being my first app, it was also a great opportunity to learn about creating interfaces and intuitive apps for the user. I'm excited about my progress and eager to continue on my journey in Android development.
